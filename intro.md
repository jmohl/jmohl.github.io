I'm a postdoc at Duke studying the [neural basis of multisensory perception](https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/). Specifically, I study the coordination of visual and auditory processing for localization of sensory stimuli. Both humans and monkeys are able to combine information from these different sensory systems in order to make the best possible decision (given limitations of sensory organs themselves). My research focuses on understanding how this is accomplished in neural structures. I address this question through a combination of behavioral modeling, single neuron electrophysiology, theory, and computational analysis of neural signals.
