## A personal website for projects

This is a simple website I've been building as a side project to hold things I've been working on and get a little experience with html and css. It is based on the [Matjek project template](https://github.com/shawnteoh/matjek) which in turn is based on [Materialize.css](http://materializecss.com/) for jekyll sites.
