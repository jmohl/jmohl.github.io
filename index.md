## About
I'm a PhD candidate at Duke University studying the [neural basis of multisensory perception](https://people.duke.edu/~jmgroh/). My research specifically deals with the integration of visual and auditory information for spatial localization in monkeys and humans. Both species are able to use these two very different sources of information to make better decisions, and appear to do so in a way that is statistically optimal given the limitations of our noisy sensory organs. Understanding how this is accomplished in neural structures is the primary focus of my research.

This site is very much a work in progress. If you are looking for something in particular, you can check out my [github page proper](https://github.com/jmohl) or contact me at jefftmohl@gmail.com
